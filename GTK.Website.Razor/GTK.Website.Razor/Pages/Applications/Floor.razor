                Epoxy floor coatings are commonly used for commercial, industrial and
                marine
                floorings. Epoxy coatings are normally applied over concrete floors and metal surface (Marine
                Applications).to provide a high performance, smooth, that can last for many year and withstand heavy
                loads.
                Many industrial sites, warehouses, commercial buildings and ships rely on epoxy floors to maintain
                clean
                and
                safe conditions for workers, equipment and inventory. We have specially designed floor coats for
                above
                mentioned applications. (Surface inspection is mandatory for floor coats for all applications).
